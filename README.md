## Things To Know ##
Throughout the entirety of the course, all resources and assignment will be available, however a week after the end of the course, this repository will be refreshed for new classes. :anguished:

*No worries though!* Part of the curriculum includes showing students how to save a repository to personal devices, so everything can be kept if one wishes to. :smile:

* [Staff Contacts](https://github.com/Jerliyah/Youth-Code-Staff) - Check in anytime, we are here to help and support even outside of regular class hours
* [Student Contacts](https://github.com/Jerliyah/Youth-Code-Students) - List of names and emails for staff and student collaboration
* HTML and CSS textbook (this pdf file is included in the repo) - For more in depth studying, readings will be assigned
